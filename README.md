Hello, my name is Harsha, and I am a techno functional IT professional with 18 years of experience. 
I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven solutions to tackle real-world problems. 
Over the past couple of years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of machine learning projects that have kepy my technical skills and deepened my understanding of the field. 
My journey started with a solid foundation in both Python programming and fundamental machine learning concepts, which I've since applied to projects ranging from predictive modeling to computer vision.. 
All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
